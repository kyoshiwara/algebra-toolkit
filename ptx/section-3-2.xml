<subsection><title>1. Multiply binomials</title>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>Expand the product <m>~(2x-3)(x-6)~</m>.</p></statement>
 
<solution><p>Multiply each term of the first binomial be each term of the second binomial. This gives four multiplications, often denoted by "FOIL," which stands for First terms, Outside terms, Inside terms, and Last terms.</p>
 <p>   <md><mrow>(2x+3)(x-6) \amp = \underline{2x \cdot x}~+~\underline{2x \cdot (-6)}~+~\underline{(-3) \cdot x}~+~\underline{(-3) \cdot (-6)}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp \quad  \quad \alert{\text{F}}\quad \quad \quad \quad \alert{\text{O}} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \alert{\text{I}} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \alert{\text{L}}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 2x^2-12x-3x+18 ~~~~~~~~\quad\blert{\text{Combine like terms.}}</mrow>
          <mrow>\amp = 2x^2-15x+18</mrow></md></p>
</solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Expand the product  <m>~-2(3x-4)(3x-5)</m>. </p></statement>
 
<solution><p>First, multiply the binomial factors together.
    <me>(3x-4)(3x-5) = 9x^2-27x+20</me>
Then use the distributive law to multiply the result by the monomial factor, <m>-2</m>.
    <me>\alert{-2}(9x^2-27x+20) = -18x^2+54x-40</me></p>

<subsection><title>2. Factor quadratic trinomials</title>

<introduction><p>To factor the trinomial <m>x^2+bx+c</m>, we look for two numbers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> whose product <m>pq</m> is the constant term and whose sum <m>p+q</m> is the coefficient of the middle term.
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
        (x+p)(x+q) \amp = x^2+qx+px+pq\\
                  \amp = x^2 +\blert{(p+q)}x +\alert{pq} = x^2+\blert{b}x+\alert{c}
                  \end{aligned}</me></p>

<assemblage><title>Sign Patterns for Quadratic Trinomials</title>
<p>Assume that <m>b,~c,~p</m> and <m>q</m> are positive integers. Then <ol label="1">
    <li><p><m>x^2+bx+c = (x+p)(x+q)</m></p>
        <p>If all the coefficients of the trinomial are positive, then both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are positive.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>x^2-bx+c = (x-p)(x-q)</m></p>
        <p>If the middle term of the trinomial is negative and the other two terms are positive, then <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are both negative.</p></li>
    <li><p><m>x^2 \pm bx-c = (x+p)(x-q)</m></p>
        <p>If the constant term of the trinomial is negative, then <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have opposite signs.</p></li>
    </ol></p></assemblage></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>Factor <m>~t^2+7t+12~</m> as a product of two binomials,
    <me>t^2+7t+12 = (t+p)(t+q)</me>
</p></statement>

<solution><p>The constant term is 12, so we look for two numbers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> whose product is 12. There are three possibilities: 
    <me>\text{ 1 and 12,      2 and 6,      or     3 and 4}</me>
Because the middle term is <m>7t</m>, we must have <m>p+q=7</m>. We check each possibility and find that <m>p=3</m> and <m>q=4</m>. Thus, 
    <me>t^2+7t+12 = (t+3)(t+4)</me>
</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Factor <m>~x^2-12x+20~</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>For this example we must find two numbers <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> for which <m>pq=20</m> and <m>p+q=-12</m>.  These two conditions tell us that <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> must both be negative. We start by listing all the ways to factor 20 with negative factors:
   <me>-1~~\text{and}~~-20,~~~~-2~~\text{and}~~-10,~~~~-4~~\text{and}~~-5</me>   
We check <m>p+q</m> for each possibility to see which one gives the correct middle term. Because <m>-2+(-10) = -12</m>, the factorization is
    <me>x^2-12x+20 = (x-2)(x-10)</me></p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Factor <m>~x^2+2x-15~</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>This time the product <m>pq</m> must be negative, so <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> must have opposite signs, one positive and one negative. There are only two ways to factor 15, either 1 times 15 or 3 times 5. We just "guess" that the second factor is negative, and check <m>p+q</m> for each possibility:
    <me>1-15=-14~~~~~~\text{or}~~~~~~3-5=-2</me>        
The middle term we want is <m>2x</m>, not <m>-2x</m>, so we change the signs of <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>: we use <m>-3</m> and <m>+5</m>.  The correct factorization is
    <me>x^2+2x-15 = (x-3)(x+5)</me></p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>3. Write algebraic expressions</title>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>Ralph and Wanda together weigh 320 pounds.  If Ralph weighs <m>x</m> pounds, how much does Wanda weigh?</p></statement>    
    
<solution><p>We subtract Ralph's weight from the total; the remainder is Wanda's weight:  <m>320-x</m>  pounds</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Delbert and Francine live 24 miles apart on Route 30.  They meet at a cafe between their houses.  If Delbert drove <m>d</m> miles, how far did Francine drive?</p></statement>    
    
<solution><p>We subtract Delbert's distance from the total; the remainder is Francine's distance: <m>24-d</m> miles</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Three eggs and two slices of buttered toast contain 526 calories.  If one egg contains <m>c</m> calories, how many calories are in a slice of buttered toast?</p></statement>    
    
<solution><p>We subtract the calories in three eggs from the total; the remainder is the number of calories in two slices of toast, so one slice has half that many calories: <m>~\frac{1}{2}(526-3c)</m></p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>The perimeter of a large rectangular playground is 124 yards.  If its width is <m>w</m> yards, what is its length?</p></statement>    
    
<solution><p>We subtract twice the length from the perimeter; the remainder is twice the width, so the width is half that: <m>~\frac{1}{2}(124-2w) = 62-w</m> yards</p></solution></example>
