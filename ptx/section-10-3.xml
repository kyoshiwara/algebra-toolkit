<subsection><title>1. Using growth and decay laws with base <m>e</m></title>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<p>We can write exponential growth and decay laws using base <m>e</m>.</p>

<assemblage><title>Exponential Growth and Decay</title>
    <p>The function
        <me>P(t) = P_0 e^{kt}</me>
        describes exponential growth if <m>k \gt 0</m>, and exponential decay if <m>k \lt 0</m>.</p>    
</assemblage>
                    
<example><statement><p>A colony of bees grows at a rate of 8% annually. Write its growth law using base <m>e</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>The growth factor is <m>~b = 1+r = 1.08~</m>, so the growth law can be written as
    <me>P(t) = P_0 (1.08)^t</me>
Using base <m>e</m>, we write <m>~P(t) = P_0 e^{kt},~</m> where <m>e^k = 1.08.</m> (You can see this by evaluating each growth law at <m>t=1</m>.) So we solve for <m>k</m>.
    <md><mrow>e^k \amp = 1.08  \amp \amp \blert{\text{Take the natural log of both sides.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\ln (e^k) \amp = \ln (1.08) \amp \amp \blert{\text{Simplify both sides.}}</mrow>
        <mrow> k \amp = 0.0770</mrow></md>
The growth law is <m>~P(t) = P_0 e^{0.077t}</m>.</p>
</solution></example>

<example><statement><p>A radioactive isotope decays according to the formula <m>~N(t)=N_0 e^{-0.016t},~</m> where <m>t</m> is in hours. Find its percent rate of decay.</p></statement>

<solution><p>First we write the decay law in the form <m>~N(t)=N_0 b^t,~</m> where <m>~b=e^k.~</m></p> 
<p>In this case, <m>~k=-0.016,~</m> so <m>~b=e^{-0.016} = 0.9841.~</m>  Now, <m>~b=1-r,~</m> and solving for <m>r</m> we find <m>~r=-0.0159.~</m> The rate of decay is approximately 16% per hour.</p>
