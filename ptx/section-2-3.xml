<introduction><p>Some familiar formulas are useful in writing equations to solve a problem.</p></introduction>

<subsection><title>1. Use the interest formula, <m>I=Pr</m></title>

<subsubsection><title>Example</title>

<example><statement><p>You have $5000 to invest for one year. You want to put part of the money into bonds that pay 7% interest, and the rest of the money into stocks that involve some risk but will pay 12% if successful. Now suppose you decide to invest <m>x</m> dollars in stocks and <m>y</m> dollars in bonds.<ol label="a">
    <li>Use the interest formula, <m>I=Pr</m>, to write expressions for the interest earned on the bonds and on the stocks.</li> 
    <li>Write an equation about the amount invested.</li>                 
    <li>Write an equation to say that the total interest earned was $400.</li></ol>     
</p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><p>Stocks: <m>I=0.12x;~~~</m>Bonds: <m>I=0.07y</m></p></li>
    <li><m>x+y=500</m></li>
    <li><m>0.12x+0.07y=400</m></li></ol></p></solution></example>

 <subsubsection><title>Exercise</title>

<exercise><statement><p>Jerry invested $2000, part in a CD at 4% interest and the remainder in a business venture at 9%.  After one year, his income from the business venture was $37 more than his income from the CD.  Now suppose Jerry invested <m>x</m> dollars in the CD and <m>y</m> dollars in the business venture. <ol label="a"> 
    <li>Use the interest formula to write expressions for the interest Jerry earned on the CD and the interest he earned on the business venture.</li>
    <li>Write an equation about the amount Jerry invested.</li>
    <li>Write an equation about the interest Jerry earned.</li></ol> </p></statement>
<answer><p><ol label="1">
    <li><m>0.04x;~~0.09y</m></li>
    <li><m>x+y=2000</m></li>
    <li><m>0.09y=37+0.04x</m></li></ol></p></answer></exercise>

<subsection><title>2. Use the percent formula, <m>P=rW</m></title>

<subsubsection><title>Example</title>

<example><statement><p>A chemist wants to produce 45 quarts of a 40% solution of carbolic acid by mixing a 20% solution with a 50% solution.  She uses <m>x</m> quarts of the 20% solution and <m>y</m> quarts of the 50% solution.<ol label="a">
    <li>Write an equation about the total amount of solution.</li>   
    <li>Use the percent formula, <m>P=rW</m>, to write expressions about the amount of carbolic acid in each original solution.</li>         
    <li>How many quarts of carbolic acid are in the mixture?</li>        
    <li>Write an equation about the amount of carbolic acid.</li></ol></p></statement> 

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li><m>x+y=45</m></li>
    <li><p>20% solution: <m>0.20x;~~~</m> 50% solution: <m>0.50y</m></p></li>
    <li><m>P=rW=0.40(45)</m></li>
    <li><m>0.20x+0.50y=0.40(45)</m></li></ol></p></solution></example>

<subsubsection><title>Exercise</title>

<exercise><statement><p>A pet store owner wants to mix a 12% saltwater solution and a 30% saltwater solution to obtain 90 liters of a 24% solution. He uses <m>x</m> quarts of the 12% solution and <m>y</m> quarts of the 30% solution.<ol label="a">
    <li>Write an equation about the total amount of saltwater.</li>
    <li>Use the percent formula to write expressions about the amount of salt in each original solution.</li>
    <li>How many liters of salt are in the mixture?</li>
    <li>Write an equation about the amount of salt.</li></ol></p></statement>
<answer><p><ol label="1">
    <li><m>x+y=90</m></li>
    <li><m>0.20x;~~0.30y</m></li>
    <li><m>0.24(90)</m></li>
    <li><m>0.20x+0.30y=0.24(90)</m></li></ol></p></answer></exercise>

<subsection><title>3. Use the distance formula, <m>d=rt</m></title>

<subsubsection><title>Example</title>    

<example><statement><p>A river steamer requires 3 hours to travel 24 miles upstream and 2 hours for the return trip downstream.  Let <m>x</m> be the speed of the current and <m>y</m> the speed of the steamer in still water.<ol label="a">
    <li>Write an equation about the upstream trip.</li>      
    <li>Write an equation about the downstream trip.</li></ol></p></statement>

<solution><p><ol label="a">
    <li>The speed of the steamer aginst the current is <m>r=y-x</m>, so <m>~3(y-x)=24</m></li>
    <li>The speed of the steamer with the current is <m>r=y+x</m>, so <m>~2(y+x)=24</m></li></ol></p></solution></example> 
</subsubsection>

<subsubsection><title>Exercise</title>

<exercise><statement><p>A yacht leaves San Diego and heads south, traveling at 25 miles per hour. Six hours later a Coast Guard cutter leaves San Diego traveling at 40 miles per hour and pursues the yacht. Let <m>x</m> be the time it takes the cutter to catch the yacht, and <m>y</m> the distance it traveled.<ol label="a">
    <li> Write an equation about the yacht's journey.</li>
    <li>Write an equation about the cutter's journey.</li></ol></p></statement>
<answer><p><ol label="1">
    <li><m>25(x+6)=y</m></li>
    <li><m>40x=y</m></li></ol></p></answer></exercise>
