<subsection><title>1. Write a linear model</title>

<introduction><p>When we say "Express <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>,"  we mean to write an equation that looks like
    <me>y = \text{algebraic expression in}~ x</me>
We say that <m>x</m> is the input variable, and <m>y</m> is the output variable.</p>

<p>In particular, a <term>linear model</term> has the form
    <me>\blert{y = \text{starting value} + \text{rate} \times x}</me></p>
</introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>
                    
<example><statement><p>Steve bought a Blu-Ray player for $269 and a number of discs at $14 each. Write an expression for Steve's total bill, <m>B</m> (before tax), in terms of the number of discs he bought, <m>d</m>.</p></statement>
                    
<solution><p>We want an equation of the form
        <me>B = \text{starting value} + \text{rate} \times d</me>
    where Steve's bill started with the Blu-Ray player or $269, and then increased by a number of discs at a rate of $14 each.  Substituting those values, we have
    <me>B=269+14d</me></p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>At 6 am the temperature was 50<m>\degree</m>, and it has been falling by 4<m>\degree</m> every hour. Write an equation for the temperature, <m>T</m>, after <m>h</m> hours.</p></statement>

<solution><p>We want an equation of the form
        <me>T = \text{starting value} + \text{rate} \times h</me>
    The temperature started at 50<m>\degree</m>, and then decreased each hour at the rate of 4<m>\degree</m> per hour, so we subtract <m>4h</m> from 50 to get
    <me>T=50-4h</me></p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Kyli's electricity company charges her $6 per month plus $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy she uses. Write an equation for Kyli's electric bill, <m>E</m>, if she uses <m>w</m> kWh of electricity.</p></statement>

<solution><p>Kyli's bill starts a6 $6 and increases by $0.10 for each kWh, <m>w</m>. Thus,
    <me>E=6+0.10w</me></p></solution></example>

<subsection><title>1. Plot points and graph a line</title>

<example><statement><p>Make a table of values, plot the points, and graph the equation <m>y=-2x+6</m>.</p></statement>

<solution><p>Choose both positive and negative values for <m>x</m>.  Calculate the <m>y</m>-value for each <m>x</m>-value by substituting the <m>x</m>-value into the equation.</p></solution></example>
</subsection>

<subsection><title>3. Solve a linear equation</title>

<introduction><p>Recall that to solve an equation we want to "isolate" the variable on one side of the equals sign. We "undo" each operation performed on the variable by performing the opposite operation on both sides of the equation.</p></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>
                    
<example><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>~~\dfrac{2}{3}x-5=7</m> </p></statement>
                    
<solution><me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                \dfrac{2}{3}x-5 \amp = 7 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Add 5 to both sides.}}\\
                \dfrac{2}{3}x \amp = 12 \amp \amp \blert{\text{To divide both sides by } \dfrac{2}{3}, \text{we:}}\\
                \dfrac{3}{2}\left(\dfrac{2}{3}x\right) \amp =\dfrac{3}{2}(12) \amp \amp \blert{\text{Multiply by the reciprocal of }\dfrac{2}{3}.}\\
                x \amp = 18 \amp \amp \blert{\text{The solution is 18.}}
                \end{aligned}</me></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Solve the equation <m>~~2x+7=4x-3</m></p></statement>

<solution>To begin, we must get both variable terms on the same side of the equation.
    <me>\begin{aligned}[t]
                2x+7 \amp = 4x-3 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Subtract}~2x~\text{from both sides.}}\\
                7 \amp = 2x-3 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Add 3 to both sides.}}\\
                10 \amp =2x   \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide both sides by 2.}}\\
                5 \amp = x \amp \amp \blert{\text{The solution is 5.}}
                \end{aligned}</me></solution></example>

<subsection><title>4. Solve a linear inequality</title>

<introduction><p>The rules for solving an inequality are the same as those for solving an equation, with one important difference:</p>

<assemblage><p>If we multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality.</p></assemblage></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example>
    <statement><p>Solve <m>~~-3x+1 \gt 7~~</m> and graph the solutions on a number line.</p></statement>
<solution><p><md><mrow>-3x+1 \amp \gt 7 \amp \amp ~\blert{\text{ Subtract 1 from both sides.}}</mrow>
            <mrow>-3x \amp \gt 6 \amp \amp\ 
            \begin{array}{l}
                \blert{\text{Divide both sides by }{-3}\text{, and reverse }}\\
                \blert{\text{the direction of the inequality.}}
                \end{array}</mrow>
        <mrow>x \amp \gt -2</mrow></md>
    The solutions are all the numbers less than <m>-2</m>.
    The graph of the solutions is shown below.</p>
    <sidebyside width="70%"><image source="images/fig-wu-1.png"><description>line graph</description></image></sidebyside>
</solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Solve <m>~~-3 \lt 2x-5 \le 6~~</m> and graph the solutions on a number line.</p></statement>

<solution><p><md><mrow>-3 \amp \lt 2x-5 \le 6 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Add 5 on all three sides of the inequality.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>2 \amp \lt 2x \le 11 \amp \amp \blert{\text{Divide each side by 2.}}</mrow>
        <mrow>1 \amp \lt x \le \dfrac{11}{2}   \amp \amp  \blert{\text{Notice that we did not reverse the inequality.}}
        </mrow></md>
The solutions are all the numbers greater than 1 but less than 5.5.
The graph of the solutions is shown below.</p>

</solution></example>

<p>Recall that a solid dot on a number line indicates that the number is part of the solution; an open dot means that the number is not part of the solution.</p>
