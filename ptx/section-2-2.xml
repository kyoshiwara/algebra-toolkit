<subsection><title>1. Identify the solution of a system</title>

<introduction><p>Recall that a solution to a system makes each equation in the system true.</p></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>Decide whether <m>(3,-2)</m> is a solution of the system 
    <md><mrow>x = 5y+13</mrow>
        <mrow>2x+3y=0</mrow></md></p> </statement>

<solution><p>A solution must satisfy both equations.  We substitute <m>x=\alert{3}</m> and <m>y=\alert{-2}</m> into the equations. 
    <md><mrow>\alert{3} = 5(\alert{-2})+13 ? \amp \amp \text{Yes}</mrow>
        <mrow> 2(\alert{3})+3(\alert{-2})=0 ? \amp \amp \text{Yes}</mrow></md>
Yes, <m>(3,-2)</m> is a solution</p></solution></example>
                    
<example><statement><p>Find the solution of the system graphed below.</p>
    <sidebyside  width="35%"><image source="images/fig-8-1-1.png"><description>graph</description></image></sidebyside>
</statement>
    
<solution><p>The solution must lie on both graphs, so it is the intersection point, <m>P</m>. The coordinates of point <m>P</m> are <m>(50, 1300)</m>, so the solution of the system is <m>t=50,~y=1300</m>. </p></solution></example>

    <md><mrow>x + 3y \amp = -9</mrow>
        <mrow>3x+2y \amp = -5</mrow></md></p></statement>

<subsection><title>2. Use the formula for profit, <m>P=R-C</m></title>

<introduction>

<assemblage><title>Profit</title>
<p>To find the profit earned by a company we subtract the costs from the revenue.
    <me>\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}~~~~~~~~P=R-C</me></p></assemblage>

<p>"Revenue" is the amount of money a company takes in from selling its product.  A negative profit is the same as a loss.</p></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>The owner of a sandwich shop spent $800 last week for labor and supplies.  She received $1150 in revenue.  What was her profit?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We evaluate the formula with <m>R=1150</m> and <m>C=800</m> to find
    <md><mrow>P \amp = R-C</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = 1150 - 800 = 350</mrow></md>
The owner's profit was $350.</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>EcoGreen made $1848 profit on low-flow shower heads last year, and spent $3426 in costs.  What was their revenue from shower heads?</p></statement>

<solution><p>We usse the profit formula and solve the equation
    <me>1848 = R - 3246</me>
to find that <m>R=5094</m>.  Their revenue was $5094.</p></solution></example>

<subsubsection><title>Exercises</title>

<exercise><statement><p><ol label="a">
    <li>The Earth Alliance made $6000 in revenue from selling tickets to Earth Day, an educational event for children.  Write an expression for their profit in terms of their costs.</li>  
    <li>What was their profit if their costs were $2500?</li></ol></p></statement>

<answer><p><ol label="a">
    <li><m>P=6000-C </m></li>
    <li>$3500</li></ol></p></answer></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Last week Moe's Auto Shop took in $5400 in revenue, but experienced a loss of $800.  What were Moe's costs last week? </p></statement>

<answer>$6200</answer></exercise>

<subsection><title>3. Write equations in two variables</title>

<introduction><p>Applied problems that involve more than one unknown are often easier to model and solve with a system of equations.</p></introduction>

<subsubsection><title>Examples</title>

<example><statement><p>Write equations about the number of tables and the number of chairs:<ol label="a">
    <li>There are four chairs for each table.</li>
    <li>Chairs cost $125 each; a table costs $350.  Darryl spent $10,200 on tables and chairs.</li></ol> 
</p></statement>
    
<solution><p>Let <m>x</m> be the number of tables and <m>y</m> the number of chairs.<ol label="a">
    <li>The number of chairs is 4 times the number of tables: <m>~y=4x</m>.</li> 
    <li><m>125y+350x=10,200</m></li></ol>  
</p></solution></example>

<example><statement><p>Write equations about the dimensions of a rectangle:<ol label="a">
    <li>The perimeter of the rectangle is 42 meters.</li>
    <li>The length is 3 meters more than twice the width.</li></ol>
</p></statement>

<solution><p>Let <m>x</m> be the width of the rectangle and <m>y</m> its length.<ol label="a">
    <li><m>2x+2y=42</m></li>  
    <li><m>y=3+2x</m></li></ol>  
</p></solution></example>

<subsubsection><title>Exercises</title>

<exercise><statement><p>Write equations about the number of calories in a hamburger and in a chocolate shake.<ol label="a">    <li>A hamburger and a chocolate shake together contain 1020 calories.</li>
    <li>Two shakes and three hamburgers contain 2710 calories.</li></ol></p></statement>
    <answer><ol label="a">
        <li><m>x+y=1020</m></li>
        <li><m>3x+2y=2710</m></li></ol></answer></exercise>

<exercise><statement><p>Write equations about the vertex angle and the base angles of an isosceles triangle.<ol label="a">
   <li>The vertex angle is <m>15 \degree</m> less than each base angle.</li>
    <li>The sum of the angles in a triangle is <m>180 \degree</m>.</li></ol></p></statement>
    <answer><p><ol label="a">
        <li><m>y=x-5</m></li>
        <li><m>2x+y=180</m></li></ol></p></answer></exercise>
